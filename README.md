# Dynamic Programming Examples: Fibonacci Series and Climbing Stairs

This repository contains JAVA implementations of solving the Fibonacci series and the climbing stairs problem using dynamic programming techniques. The solutions include:

1. Recursion: Solving the problem using a naive recursive approach, resulting in exponential time complexity, O(2^n).
2. Memoization (Top-Down): Optimizing the recursive approach by using memoization, reducing the time complexity to O(n).
3. Tabulation (Bottom-Up): Solving the problem using tabulation, achieving linear time complexity O(n).

## Problem Descriptions

### 1. Fibonacci Series : The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1
### 2. Climbing Stairs : You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
